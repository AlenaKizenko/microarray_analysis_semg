# Analysis of semenogelin 1 and semenogelin 2 expression in lung cancer

Two microarray open source datasets have been analysed (GSE3268, GSE4127)

### Analysis of semenogelin 1 and semenogelin 2 expression in lung cancer cell lines panel

Expression data containing fold-change values was downloaded from NCBI GEO Datasets. After that data was log2-transformed and quantile-quantile normalized. Rows with Semg1 and Semg2 were subsetted, heatmaps were built.

### Analysis of semenogelin 1 and semenogelin 2 expression in squamous lung cancer and normal tissue

Expression data containing fold-change values was downloaded from NCBI GEO Datasets. As data was already normalized, rows with Semg1 and Semg2 were subsetted, heatmaps were built.
